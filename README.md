### Flutter
Flutter is designed as a simple microblogging platform reference app. Users post messages to the timeline while other users follow them.

The goal of the project is to have an application that is complex enough to do something while allowing me to interchange various microservices if I desire to test out or experiment with a new technology. For example, a microservice could be written in Python while another is in Java without conflicts or dependencies.

See my blog at http://thedigitallink.net/posts/ for more information.
